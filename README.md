# private-events

A site similar to a private Eventbrite which allows users to create events and then manage user signups. Users can create events and send invitations to other users to attend. It follows the mapping of Advanced Associations and Active Record queries to query and filter while dealing to many to many database relations and using through tables for the associations.
